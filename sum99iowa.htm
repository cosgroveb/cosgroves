<p><img SRC="srlorraine.jpg" height=256 width=200 align=LEFT><font size=+0 face="Century Gothic">Kath
and I had an interesting time in Iowa this summer, tracing our roots. We
have been to Ireland, but the missing link to us seems to be the generation
that was born in the States. We wanted to see the cemeteries, look at the
newspaper records and survey the area! We went first to Dubuque, looking
for information about Bishop Cosgrove's mother and uncles. We discovered
that a great niece of the Bishop's, Sister Lorraine, is living in Chicago.
She still visits relatives in Dubuque and Farley.</font><font face="Century Gothic">

<p><font size=+0 face="Century Gothic">She sent me a picture of herself this
Christmas (on left with a friend from Farley).</font><font face="Century Gothic">

<img border="0" src="francetrewin.jpg" width="242" height="367" align="right">We
went on to Waucoma and then to Lawler. All of the Caseys, Burnses and Doyles
seemed to have settled in or near these little towns when they got here
from Ireland. Both towns are smaller today than when our great-great grandparents
were living in the area, and are full of Irish. Bishop Cosgrove attracted
many Irish immigrants out to Iowa, and this area of low rolling hills and
vistas reminds us a lot of Monaghan. Waucoma is very quiet--only one place
to eat and nowhere to stay. With the river dammed in the middle of town,
forming a charming lake, we can see how cool and lovely it must have been
for vacations when Grandma and Grandpa were young. Right away we met a
cousin. Frances Trewin was raised in Waucoma; her connection is through
our Great Grandfather, Ed Doyle's brother James. James II's daughter Bessie
(Mary Elizabeth) Burke was Frances's mother. She died at age 85; buried
in Waucoma . Frances would be Dad's, Sheila's and John's second cousin.</font>
</font>
<p><font size=+0 face="Century Gothic">These Doyle's have a wonderful family
history--bound in paper--that traces back to Ireland. Frances Trewin was
in Ireland three years ago, and she talked to some Doyles in Tramore that
were the descendents of the Doyles who stayed back. They lived in the same
Doyle homestead. They have photocopies of records that showed they were
tenants of Cullen Castle since the 1600's.</font><font face="Century Gothic">
</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">This is included here in another section.</font><p>
<font size=+0 face="Century Gothic">The Doyle Family History that the Waucoma
Branch worked on, has Great Great Grandma Doyle's name as Mary Flannery.
This is Ed's mother. She came to the US with her mother Margaret and brother
Patrick after her father, a professor, died in Ireland. She married James
in Vermont, had two children, lived briefly in Warren, IL, (Jo Davies County)
had another child, then they came west to Waucoma in a covered wagon. Her
brother went off to serve in the Civil War and was never heard from again,
according to this account.</font><font face="Century Gothic">

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><img SRC="burnshomepl.jpg" height=253 width=383 align=LEFT><font size=+0>In
Lawler we found Burnses at the Burns home place. This is the house built
by our Great-Great Grandfather's son. The original place, built by the
first Owen Burns and nearer Waucoma, burned down. We got to meet our third
cousin, David Burns, and his delightful mother, Marilyn. She, although
she was only married to a Burns, has begun to assemble a history for her
children and grandchildren. This is the home place:</font> </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">&nbsp;I continue to update with information as I
get it, but I still have not transcribed all Kathleen's and my research
from the summer. We unexpectedly began working on the German side too when
we met even more cousins in the Amanas!
