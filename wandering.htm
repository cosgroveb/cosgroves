<p><font face="Century Gothic">"Ireland's flying" Paddy Neville told us in Dublin, and everyone else
seems to agree. The grinding poverty we were afraid to find that broke
the hearts of visitors as late as 10 years ago seems to be gone. The gray,
broken cottages we expected to see in the country are brightly--wildly--painted
villages with prosperous shopping areas and full pubs. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Kathleen and I have investigated all the castles around the Emerald
Isle. We thought this might be the home of the Cosgroves:<img SRC="castle1.jpg" height=390 width=584 align=RIGHT>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Or perhaps this: </font>

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><font face="Century Gothic">We know we ARE "to the manor born":

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><font face="Century Gothic">After extensive research, however, we discovered THIS is the one!!
</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="irefarm.jpg" height=235 width=367></center>

<p><font face="Century Gothic">Seriously, we saw some fabulous scenery, toured more castles and gardens
than Kathleen had ever dreamed we would, met a lot of interesting people,
endured more "Irish breakfasts" than anyone should have to face,&nbsp;
learned more history than we wanted to and drove like maniacs. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Observations: </font>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Century Gothic">It got light at 4 a.m. and dark at 10:30 p.m.--Ireland is as far north
as Denmark and Nova Scotia!</font></li>
<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Century Gothic">There are palm trees from the middle of the island south--the Gulf Stream
makes Ireland warm, and creates the almost constant rains and mists.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic">Wild rhododendrons are choking the forests. They are huge, and far more
of them than you find in the woods of North Carolina.</font></li>
</ul>

<font face="Century Gothic">Favorite places:<img SRC="ardgroom.jpg" height=201 width=299 align=RIGHT>
</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Century Gothic">We liked the Beara Peninsula. Unlike the Ring of Kerry, the Ring of Beara
doesn't get tourists buses. As the designated driver, Kathleen discovered,
there is a reason for this. What passes for a two-lane road over there
is one lane by our standards, and the hedges obscure any view of what might
be coming at you! Here is a scene of Ardgroom, on the Beara Peninsula--
another tiny village vying for the "Tidy Towns" award, with gallons of
fresh paint.</li> </font>

<br>&nbsp;
</ul>
&nbsp;<ul>
<li>
<font face="Century Gothic">A girls-just-wanna-have-fun view of Kenmare, one of our favorite towns,
in a pub we visited:<img SRC="kenmare.jpg" height=195 width=294>&nbsp;<img SRC="kenpub.jpg" height=186 width=293></li>

<br>&nbsp;</font></ul>
<font face="Century Gothic">Our favorite of the gardens we saw was at Mucross House near Killarney.
It was huge and had great vistas in the European&nbsp; style. . .</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img SRC="mucross.jpg" height=213 width=353>
<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">We wearied of B &amp; B breakfasts and had great difficulty finding
a place--any place--near Dublin. As luck would have it, we stumbled into
the Killiney Coast Hotel at Killiney Bay south of Dublin. They took a voucher,
and therefore it was affordable. As we later discovered, Ireland is full
of beautiful old hotels, all over the country in the most unexpected of
places.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>T<font face="Century Gothic">he oldest place we stayed was the Grand Inn at Nine Mile House a village
on the way to Killkenny. If you can't see the date, it's 1690. Ninemilehouse
is 9 miles from Kells. Not the famous Kells, but another Kells--ruins from
the eighth through the twelfth centuries. It was beautiful, and empty,
like so many ruins throughout the whole island. . .

somewhere between Kingscourt and Galway: </font>

<font face="Century Gothic">Here one sees the ambiance so welcome to Dad--now we know it is genetic!!
</font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Speaking of pubs, our favorite in the home 
village of Burnses, Cassidys, Caseys and Brennans--
<br>CARRICKMACROSS-- is the pub of Linus McDonnell.
<br>Linus was our history source for the unrecorded
<br>handmedown stories of Monaghan &amp; the notorious Shirleys.
<br>Raconteur extraordinaire: </font>

<br>
<br>&nbsp;Paddy Neville showed us Dublin. We saw Trinity College, St. Pat's and
Paddy's favorite pubs and restaurants. The insider's tour was definitely
more fun than wandering on our own that day. None of the continual Irish
"soft rain" in Dublin! It came down in buckets, just like at home. </font>

<br>&nbsp; <font face="Century Gothic">Powerscourt Gardens, no more beautiful than Mucross, were nonetheless
impressive: Ennis., as you can see, was charming (on right): </font>

<img border="0" src="ckmcrs2.jpg" width="250" height="360"><br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Century Gothic">The beautiful parish of Magheracloone, consisting now only of a few
signs, a couple scattered churches surrounded by their cemetaries like
chicks around a hen. Here is the countryside our greatgreatgreats gazed
upon daily: </font>
<br><img SRC="magheracloone.jpg" height=331 width=655>
<br><font face="Century Gothic">St. Molua's, Church of Ireland is the oldest church in the parish,
and has the graves of both RC and C of I in it. Many tombstones, now unreadable,
are stacked against the low stone walls of the churchyard. Those that are
left date back to the late 1600s.<img SRC="stmolkat.jpg" height=190 width=288 align=RIGHT>
<br>You see the church from a distance and Kathleen recording the cemetery
inscription for the Burnses buried in St. Molua's: </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">This is the sign in Gaelic, or Irish as they usually say, identifying
a park in what we call Magheracloone (Ma-her-a -kloon). Most of this parish
was part of the Shirley Estate and our ancestors their tenants. Without
a doubt, their struggling and unhappy tenants, for the Shirleys were legendary
for their meanness and brutality.<img SRC="maghsign.jpg" height=188 width=292 align=LEFT>

<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic">No one's Irish journey is complete without a view of the sea. This was
taken near the Aran Islands, to the west of Ireland.</font>

just about the clearest sky in our 16 days)</font><p align="left">

<font face="Century Gothic">This is by no means all of our pictures, not even a capsule of what we
saw. Our fondest wish is that you too can someday see Ireland for yourself.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">A place of friendly people that feels like home, turbulent history,
magnificent vistas and ubiquitous pubs. We "blew in" from America, and
liked what we saw!
