(Larry), Kathleen and Darrell were born. Ed worked for the Milwaukee RR,
and they lived briefly in Oxford Junction, Iowa, where Conan was born.
Later they moved to Calmar, Iowa, then in 1904 to Davenport where Agnita,

<font size=+2 face="Monotype Corsiva">Remembering Agnes Doyle:</font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><b>Moira remembers "Grandma Doyle"</b>
<br><i>My earliest memories of Grandma Doyle were during the early fifties
when she was 80 or older. After Dad graduated from Chiropody school we
came back to the Quad Cities. I was 3 and a half or 4, Jim was a baby.
We lived for a short time in the downstairs back bedroom of Grandma Doyle's
house before we got an apartment downtown over the Elks club. I think Grandma
Kathleen &amp; Jack also lived there, and we certainly must have been crowding
them. At any rate, I visited with her upstairs one day. She told me that
when she was a little girl, they came to Iowa on a wagon. She said they
saw rattlesnakes, and she was very afraid of them. Also, she was very afraid
of Indians. They saw Indians too, but not in any frightening way. I was
supposed to not bother her or go upstairs to her apartment, so I have really
only this one memory. We got her TV after she died. The first one we had.</i>
<br><b>John Cosgrove says:</b>
<br><i>&nbsp;His grandmother was the "nicest woman", always taking care
of the family and doing for others. All the kids were big on the social
scene according to John. Don's wife's parents owned the Coliseum Ballroom,
the "Col", in Davenport. He was a bellhop there. They (Don &amp; his wife)
ran away to get married, and Agnes found out later. Also Conan was secretly
married, in the rectory of the Cathedral, not a "Catholic" wedding.&nbsp;
John also remembers that Dolores could really do the Charleston.</i>
<br><b>Sheila Cosgrove Kautz remembers:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><i>Grandma Doyle wanted a TV and so all the families chipped
in to get her one for Christmas. In those days they were 6" to 10". Hers
was supposed to be 8", but she wasn't sure it was. So we got a measuring
tape to make sure it was 8 inches. She loved to sit and watch TV when she
wasn't watching the activity of the neighbors out the window. (Moira's
note: Our family got the TV when Grandma Doyle died in '52--we were thrilled,
our first!)</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;She always baked her famous Ice Bar cookies and they were
in the cookie jar in the pantry and if one was quiet and didn't cause problems
at her house, she told you that you could go to the jar and take one cookie--she
rationed them out!! For awhile after we moved from Dover Court we rented
her downstairs apartment after Gallaghers moved to 1109 West 17th Street.
(Moira: When Dad finished Chiropody School in Chicago we lived there too
in a back bedroom of that same apartment for a couple of months--Jimmy
was a small baby. I don't remember the pantry, but I remember the back
stairs in that house. I always thought of it as a secret passage).</i>
<br><b>Jim Cosgrove remembers:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><i>Grandma Doyle had a brother Will Burns (wife Mary)
from Phoenix who would come to visit. That part of the family came from
Northern Iowa. In June of 1912, Will and Mary moved to Phoenix because
he had been diagnosed with TB.&nbsp; When they got there, they lived in
a "shack". He recovered and sold real estate and also bought some during
Phoenix's phenomenal growth period, and was quite successful. His business
was Burns Investment Company. Agnita (his niece, Agnes' daughter) lived
with them when she had TB in the thirties.</i> </font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><b>Moira remembers:</b> </font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><i>&nbsp;We used to visit with Sr. Huberta at the motherhouse in Cedar
Rapids, maybe once with Carmela. Sister Carmela died first; Sister Huberta
retired to the motherhouse and died in the '50's. Sister Huberta was really
old at her last teaching assignment, somewhere I think in the Northwest.
The kids literally drove her crazy, I was told. They were both Sisters
of Mercy (?) Motherhouse in Cedar Rapids. My dad had met the bishop as
a young boy at family parties during the Depression when they would all
get together. It was years ago when he would tell me about those. Mostly
the Doyles got together, and the nuns Huberta and Carmela would wear regular
clothes. Once dad and his cousins knocked on the door, pretending to be
the bishop and the nuns had to scamper back and put on their habits...the
boys must have been successful at their trick because dad never forgot
it.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Ed Doyle was a switchman for the Milwaukee Railroad and, according
to Dad, drove a Model T coupe. He bought it in '21 or '22. Dad got to ride
in it--but not till he was 7 or 8. It had planetary gears, he recalled,
and three pedals. It would inch along, and you had to put gas in the tank
under the passenger seat. You had to crank to start the engine, and once
the engine backfired and broke Ed's wrist. Later he had an Olds Touring
Sedan that our Grandma Kathleen learned to drive (and her brothers did
too). It had an electric starter. . .He died at age 65 of a heart attack,
suffered at work. His son, Darrell, was with him when he died.&nbsp; Before
I was born, in their house on Iowa Street, Agnes kept priests as boarders--the
place was not far from the cathedral.</i> </font>
<br><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><font size=+2>Remembering Ed Doyle:</font></font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><b>Pat Doyle remembers his grandfather:</b>
</font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><b>&nbsp;</b><i>Our great grandfather, Edward Doyle, sat me on his
lap in the living room of their two story house on 8th (sic) and Iowa streets.
He let me admire and touch his pipe collection on a small table next to
his chair; he let me fish in his coat pocket for the candied mint I found
there when I was four or five. He was tall, bony with a narrow face and
pointed chin and shock of hair, nearing his retirement age from the Rock
Island Lines railroad. He died of a heart attack without collecting a cent
of his pension, not payable to his widow. My dad was shaving for work when
the telephone call from his mother told him the news--1935, '37? He lay
in state in his living room for an evening when the family gathered for
the wake. Only a few candles around his coffin illuminated the room. Then
he was gone.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;My dad [Darrell] told of how Grandpa could swim the Mississippi
River on his lunch hour and back from the Rock Island shore. (Once? One
summer, most of his years?) Grandpa had a passenger pass the family could
use for travel on the lines. Dad took advantage of it when he was scouting
for a job in his early years. (Did your Grandmother ever use it?) Dad showed
me a news clipping that described Grandpa's bout of sleeping sickness that
lasted nearly a month.</i> </font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><b>He also remembers family gatherings:</b>
</font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><i><b>&nbsp;</b>The Doyles, (including Gallaghers, Cosgroves and later
Pete Petersen, Agnita's husband), assembled at Grandma's [Doyle] for Thanksgiving,
Christmas and Fourth of July celebrations for several years. Larry, Esther,
Jerry, Patsy and Marilyn drove in from Chicago; Clinton Doyles, Marion
and Don, Steve, Bob, their sister, Donna and little Eddie; I don't recall
Conan but once with his wife (girlfriend?); Sisters Huberta and Carmella
from their Dubuque convent; the Phoenix Burns, Poppa and his girls occasionally.
I don't think we ever missed one of those free meals at Grandma's. Most
of the adults sipped a highball before dinner (including the Sisters--who
would tell Mother Superior?). No singular incidents occurred that I remember--no
posing for photos. Agnita usually played a few popular ballads (no lessons,
she played by ear). Larry often performed his monologue of rescuing little
Nell from the well, ad-libbing a different script each time. Larry played
for the Cincinnati Reds one season, and had been in the Army in WWI. My
dad was called up to report for induction on 11 November, 1918. Selective
Service was closed that day, celebrating the Armistice--his story.
<br>&nbsp;When I began dating Ann it was important for me to get Grandma
Doyle's approval. She invited us to dinner (in her kitchen, not enough
of a crowd to set the dining room table). I believe she offered us a glass
of wine. I had alerted Ann to Grandma's custom of politely belching aloud
in a slight, rolling stutter. She was a pleasant companion and a gracious
hostess and gratefully refrained from any special advice. I liked Grandma. </i>

It was their first family car and had no heater. After that they had a
'33 then a '38 Chevy.</font></i><font size="2">
<br></font><i><font size="2">&nbsp;One summer Jack and Kathleen won a trip to French Lick (an
Indiana resort) and John and Jim stayed with Grandma Doyle. She took them
one day to the Palmer School (which is what we've always called Palmer
College of Chiropractic; she rented to Palmer students). Palmer had, and
still does, a garden with little Asian statues. A little guy with a Vandyke
beard--old--came out and took them through the "Little Bit of Heaven" and
bought them an ice cream cone, which at the time cost a dime. It was B.J.
Palmer.</font></i> </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Sheila Cosgrove Kautz remembers:
<br><i>&nbsp;<font size="2">My earliest recollections are of when we lived on Dover Court
near Vanderveer Park. Mom &amp; Dad frequently went to the Elks Club and
my brother Tom age 15 or 16 babysat with me and was always changing the
time on the clocks so he could get me to bed earlier. A cute girl lived
next door and he'd sneak over there and keep her company when she babysat
her younger brother. I remember several times that he hid in the bushes
and scratched the window--then she'd call him to come over and keep her
company--sometimes he'd bring me over and put me on the living room couch
to read and they'd go to the kitchen, play music on the radio and dance.</font></i><font size="2">
<br><i>&nbsp;I spent many days at Mary Carroll's and her sister Winnie's
across the street playing with their cats, as I couldn't have pets because
of Mom's asthma.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Holidays were special--the Darrell Doyles, Gallaghers, Larry
&amp; Esther (from Chicago), and Clinton Doyles all got together for big
dinners at Gallaghers' at 7th and Iowa. (They lived downstairs in an apartment.)
All the aunts had their chores--Esther was in charge of peas, Dolores was
mashed potatoes, and Kathleen, gravy. My dad, Jack, always carved the bird!
At Thanksgiving, we always had turkey notes and the grandchildren made
these and we all had some good laughs--I still remember Dolores's favorite:
"Turkey neck, turkey heart, was it you who let the fart?"</i> </font></font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Pat Doyle remembers:
<br><i><font size="2">It seems we made regular visits to the Cosgroves on Dover Court
for conversations or cards for the grownups while we rummaged upstairs
in Tommy's room, reviewing his comic book collection or playing tag in
their backyard. I remember Uncle Jack, usually in his undershirt, (barefooted
during the hot fall Sunday afternoons), listening to the Bears games on
the radio. There was usually a lot of laughing (at what?), amid whatever
gossip came to mind when we bothered to listen. I don't know of any other
families who enjoyed humor so much as those micks. Dolores and Agnita always
had a new joke to share while the menfolk sprinkled their reminiscences
with jests or salty language for amusing effect. Jack, Gallagher and Larry
were all salesmen who collected anecdotes to share with customers and family
alike.</font></i><font size="2">

time when you and Jimmy were small and your family was living in downtown
Davenport.&nbsp; The next thing I recall is while I was at Marycrest, and
Sheila and Barry were engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember that your Mom was
at a bridal shower that Naomi gave for Sheila.&nbsp; Also, I know that
Mike and I are godparents to one of your brothers, but not sure which one,

<font face="Century Gothic">Remembering Darrell: </font>
<font size=2 face="Century Gothic">
<br><i>Moira remembers:</i>
<br><i>I thought Darrell's sons Eddie and Don were my uncles. Once or twice
when we lived above the Elks club they came by (individually) and took
me out for a milkshake. I thought they were the funniest and most glamorous
men I had ever met. It was very exciting to me.&nbsp; All my Irish relatives
impressed me with the fact they were always pulling your leg and cracking
a joke. I was constantly in awe at what I considered great wit.&nbsp; (Sheila
and Tommy in those days were no exception.)</i>
<br><b><i>Pat Doyle remembers</i></b>
<br><i>When I was seven or eight I decided to take my little brother Eddy
and littler sister, Judy, to visit Grandma; simply because I knew the way.
It was near a mile and a half, crossing the 'busy' thoroughfares: Harrison,
Main and Brady Streets. It was a pleasant, sunny morning in which I was
so preoccupied with the excursion I neglected to mention the<b> </b>outing
to Mother. We arrived safely, had a nice visit, then Grandma phoned Mom,
who phoned Dad to leave the newspaper to go fetch us home. I'm sure I was
impressed with a series of admonitions so readily forgotten. It was, after
all, an expression of filial piety to my Father's mother . . .</i>

<br><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Julie remembers:
<br>&nbsp;<i>My Dad's father, JT, Sr., worked for the Rock Island Railroad
and was killed while painting the Arsenal Bridge when Dad was an infant.&nbsp;
Dad and his four brothers all worked for the Rock Island Railroad in their
early years and all stayed connected to the railroad or the trucking business.&nbsp;
Dad then became Sales Manager at Gordy Freight Lines in Moline, where your
Uncle John also worked for a time.&nbsp; Later Dad held the same position
at Chicago Tri-Cities Motor Freight in Rock Island.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;My Mom was the youngest of the seven Doyle children and your
Grandmother was the oldest.&nbsp; Mom worked in the office at Sears Roebuck
before she and Dad were married and was a homemaker during our growing-up
years.&nbsp; Then for a few years, she worked for Scott County, I believe,
as an assistant to some elderly ladies in their homes.&nbsp; Also, she
and Dad worked part-time for a friend reviewing freight billings.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;After Grandma Doyle died, our home at 1109 West 17th Street
in Davenport became the official or perhaps unofficial Doyle family gathering
place.&nbsp; Mom often said she couldn't imagine retiring to Florida or
California...she would miss everyone too much.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Both Mom and Dad enjoyed potluck dinners and playing bridge
with their friends.&nbsp; Also, when we were all newly marrieds -- Mary
&amp; Gene, Mike &amp; Dottie and Paul &amp; I -- often spent an evening
playing bridge or rap poker with Mom &amp; Dad.</i> </font>
