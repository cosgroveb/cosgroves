1400 General Qtrs. 115 secured, planes were fortresses coming back from
Germany. 2140. Anchored, air raids ahead. Watched air raid on town up the
coast. Enemy didn't see us. Anti-aircraft very pretty till we saw a plane
bust into flame &amp; fall. Bombs flashed in the heart of the town. Lovely
welcome.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underway at 0200.
All quiet. All the harbors along here are collecting points for invasion
ships. Jerry drops in every nite to discourage us. Nice. Sleepless nites
ahead. Ship in convoy hit a mine. Tough. We wait while minesweepers go
to work. Ship sinks. Wonder how many got it. German planes last nite dropped
free mines in the channel among other things. </font>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still waiting till channel is cleared. 0140. Gen

miles downstream from Southhampton. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>April 29</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still at anchor. Good Lord, the ships here. Mammoth
transports, freighters, tankers, Lst's, LCT's, LCI's, DE's, Lcup's, and
others I've never seen before. All day long ships pass us going up to Southhampton
empty &amp; come back loaded with troops &amp; equipment. What a sight.
Stood on deck &amp; counted 560 ships today, and this is just one anchorage
in the harbor. No air raids. Bad weather is the reason. Full nites sleep.
What a luxury. </font>

the town on trolleys (pardon--trams) Not an awful lot left to see. At least
half the town demolished, or damaged. No raid. </font>
<p><i><font face="Century Gothic">May 2</font></i><font face="Century Gothic">
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Docked as before. Ashore again. Beer &amp; whiskey
shortage is pitiful. British 8th Army (some units) are here &amp; they
don't like Americans. Trouble all the time. We're not allowed to wander
around alone. Only in groups. The American Indian (damn niggers) have made
quite a hit with some of the English babes here. Its a common sight to
see white women &amp; niggers together. Even necking in the park. Good
God. </font>

The rest of our Flotilla arrived from Plymouth. Coming up the coast last
night they were attacked by E-boats, 10 miles from here. One sunk, one
blown up (magazine hit) another badly damaged. Very few survivors. Most

in convoy. Poor devils. </font>

know how many they got on the first two but the searchlites caught 3 Jerries
on the third raid. They dumped their loads to try &amp; get away. We saw
the bombs fall, and it seemed like each plane was held up on stilts of
tracers. One German plane simply disintegrated. The other two burst into
flame. The searchlite caught one parachute &amp; followed it down. Shells
and flack chunks fell all around us and fragments clanked on the deck incessantly.
No reminders necessary to wear helmets now. -- 0630 Underway. 1845 Arrived

of them married to white girls here. Fights common. These girls think they
are lucky. Plan to go back to the States, become citizens &amp; live happily

action on French coast between LeHavre and Cherbourg peninsula. Germans
nervously report commando raids south of Seine estuary. We are at battle
stations. Near beach. Hear warships shelling the beach and working back
up to the hidden gun emplacements. We pass them. Over us, wave after wave
of heavy, medium and fighter bombers dive down and plaster the beach and
every suspicious object. The mines on the beach are exploding from concussions
and planes strafing. Barbed wire, and steel rail entanglements are disappearing.
We move in closer. The first wave of landing craft have hit the beach.
They were ducks, and almost every one grounded on mines. The first men
to hit the beach are dead, wounded, and weaponless. They didn't last long.
The succeeding waves come in, one after another. They made it by sheer
weight of numbers. Things are behind schedule, so the bigger ships are
trying to get in - tank lighters, LC1's, and LCT's. They are not successful.
We have dropped anchor. Won't go in today we hear. The beach strip is in
our hands but it looks like a junkyard. Good God, so much smashed equipment.
The mines are exploding constantly. Back in the hills, the cruisers shells
are raising hell. An ammo dump back there goes up and raises a tremendous
cloud of smoke. The wrecked landing craft are burning high &amp; dry on
the beach as the tide runs out. Now we can see the under water entanglements
that wrecked so many boats. As the water recedes, the boats are hung on
them. Also bodies. Some bodies drift by the ship on the outgoing tide.
Amphibious trucks are coming alongside, as we are the nearest to the beach
of the big ships, full of wounded. We haven't unloaded our cargo and can't
take them. It's rough water --- those craft and must be hell on the poor
bastards. The 1st aid clearing station is set up in a wrecked concrete
pillbox. But not long, It got a direct hit from a German gun back in the
hills. We wonder how the other beaches are making out. We are only about
1000 yards inland and the troops have paid, to us, what seems a hell of
a price. I have seen so many things today, I can't write of them all, and
don't want to. No enemy planes, thank God. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">2300 - It has just turned dark. There
were planes overhead a few minutes ago and all hell broke loose. What a
concentration of flak. Low hanging clouds kept the planes out of sight.
No bombs. Down the coast - south, where the other beach is there is a heavy
attack. The bomb bursts are tremendous. An oil tanker is burning brilliantly.
The long lines of tracers weave like snakes as they climb in the wind.
Now its quiet and we try to get some sleep. </font>
<p><i><font face="Century Gothic">June 7, 1944 (D-Day + 1)</font></i><font face="Century Gothic">
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0120 - Air raid
which lasted the remainder of the nite. At least, the ships kept firing
intermittently, but no bombs dropped, no planes fell. Still raising hell
down the coast. The beach is 4 miles deep this morning, we hear. The waves
of planes come over at first light &amp; continue all day, blasting the
hills. The warships are still shelling. -- 1430 Underway into the beach.
Arrived o.k. What a hell of a mess it is close hand. The mines still go
off, and safe areas on the beach are marked off with white tape. Most of
the beach is still the dangerous area. Bulldozers, a couple got ashore,
are scraping out a half ass road for trucks, tanks &amp; people to use.
Bodies are being collected as fast as the areas around them can be de-mined.
Except in case of wounded. The medics go after them, in spite of mines
and all. And a lot have been killed or maimed. The germans have a fiendish
bastard of a one that blows off your legs and throws scrap metal into your
crotch. Our cargo is off and we're getting lots of wounded like that. The
medics on board are working like mad. The two doctors are operating continuously.
The tide has gone out so we are high and dry. it is getting dark, and the
tide is coming in. We help carry in wounded. We have accomodations for
300. Already we have 480 and still they come. We cram them into every available
space. Several are Jerries. They're scared. Expect to be shot. But they
get the same treatment as ours. Four men have died. The tide is coming
in. We pull off the beach sometime around 0200 tomorrow, I hope. </font>

<i>June 8 (D-Day +2)</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0003 - The bombing has begun in earnest. The Jerries
are plastering the beach, and thats us. The blasts are rocking the ship
and fragments are smashing the sides &amp; top deck. Still they are operating
on the wounded. We don't dare fire, and give away our positions.&nbsp;
0130 - The bombing has stopped, we're OK and are pulling off the beach.
Most of us haven't been in our bunks for 24 hours or more. We sleep at
our stations when we can, on the decks. The bombing begins again. The beach
is getting hell, and two ships have been hit. One, a Liberty ship, sinks
slowly.&nbsp; 0445. Bombing over with. More loads of wounded cruising around
looking for LST's. We are overcrowded now, and the ship reeks with that
damn sweetish smelling gas gangrene. Its sickening. With morning, the Jerry
flyers have beat it. We moved further out &amp; anchored, waiting for orders
to go back to Eng. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>June 9, 1944&nbsp;&nbsp; D + 3</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0045 -- Theres a hell of a raid going on. I have
been on deck watching. We have the engines running, ready to head for the
beach if we're hit. A Corvette, about a half mile away is blown up &amp;
sunk. They were firing and the Jerry dived down their tracer &amp; blasted
it. We hear screaming, and our small boat goes over for survivors. They
dont find any. A duck finds 3. We take them. LST 920 gets hit on the stern
&amp; sinks slowly. Slowly enough to get the wounded off on some big barges.
Then a tanker got hit &amp; blayed up, lighting up the harbor. Theres a
curtain of shells going up. The search lite on the beach catches a Jerry.
He dives on it &amp; machine guns it out. Then he tried to climb and his
wing was shot off. He hit the beach at a hell of a clip and rolled over
burning, and smashing thru men and equipment. Its as bright as day now,
what with the tanker, the plane and several trucks burning. The cruiser
is nearby and its pom poms are going whump -- The wounded down below are
yelling and the medics are giving hypos to quiet them. Two of the Jerries
have died.

0800, Anchored at Omaha beach, American beachhead. This was really a hellhole.
800 casualties within 1 hour after the 1st wave hit. Had to storm the Jerry
gun emplacements. Bombs &amp; shells couldn't knock them out. Lots of wreckage
here. There is a small beach, then steep hills. Very hard to land. On June
10, the Americans were in 16 miles, but that nite the 17 Panzers broke
thru &amp; got within 2 miles of the beach, but were cut to pieces &amp;
pushed back. They haven't had time to get all the snipers in the hills
&amp; bullets whip into the beach every so often even now.&nbsp; 1806 ,
On the beach. Sneaked off the ship &amp; looked around. Saw a prisoner
pen. Some French women snipers are prisoners here too. They will be shot.
There is an airfield up on one of the hills already. First one in France.
Wounded coming aboard now. Very few prisoners at this beach. The boys found
too many paratroopers hung in the trees by Germans who hated them. The
boys are so mad they aren't taking many prisoners. </font>

miles off the beach. Quiet day. except for mines going off all over, on
shore.&nbsp; 2300 - Evening entertainment started with Gen. Qtrs and the
heaviest air raid here yet. The Jerries really gave the harbor hell. Strong
wind blowing and tracers are weaving all over the sky like snakes. LST
30, about 200 yds away, opened up and got a German bomb off her stern.
Killed most of the After gun crews. We can hear them screaming, the wounded
I mean. We tossed smoke pots into the water, one was faulty &amp; burned
like a flare. It drifted only a few yards off where a Jerry strafed it,
just missing the ship. Harbor is blanketed in smoke now. </font>

Starting to unload.&nbsp; 1630&nbsp; Unloaded and we are playing football
on the beach. A lone Jerry pilot spotted the crowd of Limeys watching the
game &amp; dived down to strafe us. We scattered and every gun on the beach
opened up. The Jerry never pulled out of the dive, but hit the beach about
150 ft. from the ship. We all ran up, but it was burning like hell. Had
to watch all those souvenirs burn up. No more football. </font>

into the water without a scratch. Then two small boats raced to see who
could pick him up first. They both reached him at once and broke the pilots

are immense bomb craters. All over the city were the flak towers.&nbsp;
Concrete gun platforms on steel girders, about 75 ft. high, used against
low level bombers. Most of the big buildings &amp; towers are shot up,
as fanatical German snipers held out in them.&nbsp; The Germans had only
left three weeks ago, and the battle area is only 25 miles to the North.
The harbor is filled with sunken ships, scuttled by Germans, and ours lost
by mines. Four hour liberty &amp; I have some work to do on the main engine.
What a dirty piece of luck. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 17, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The liberty party last nite had a whale of a time.
Plenty of Lager beer, wine, and champagne.&nbsp; They were all drunk.&nbsp;
No Americans here. All Limey, so the boys made a big hit.&nbsp; Bought
fresh fruit &amp; ice-ream.&nbsp; This is a dairy country. I shall go ashore
this afternoon.&nbsp; 1300&nbsp; damn, we are loading battle weary troops
going to England for a rest. They are veterans of the 1st Airborne Army,
cut to pieces at Arnheim.&nbsp; 1359 Underway for England, sub chaser escort.&nbsp;
Hope we go to London or Southend, rather than Southhampton -- maybe we'll
hit Ostende again. Soon as the Scheldt pocket is cleaned out we'll go up
the Scheldt Estuary to Antwerp, I think.&nbsp; We are getting around a
little. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 18, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bad storm in the channel.&nbsp; We rolled like hell.&nbsp;
A few times we thought we'd turn turtle.&nbsp; We are low on fuel &amp;
water so are top heavy.&nbsp; 0900 -- Thames Estuary and we anchor off
Southend. 1100 -- Underway&nbsp; 1400 -&nbsp;&nbsp; Thru locks into Tullbury
Basin. Pulled up on loading ramp and unloading our troops.&nbsp;&nbsp;
No sign of liberty. Be just like our captain to ask for a load &amp; head
out again. And us so close to London here.&nbsp; Liberty at 1630.&nbsp;
Payday at 1900.&nbsp; I'm staying aboard for pay. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 19, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got paid last nite. $104. Made out a m.o. for $52.
Mail today. Wonderful. Liberty at 1400.&nbsp; Ed, Walt &amp; I are going
to London, 45 min. from here. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 20, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liberty was o.k. Saw a show "Going My Way". Swell.
Spent some time in Red Cross &amp; in pubs.&nbsp; Kidded the Picadilly
Commandos. Made believe we were customers &amp; tried to beat down the
price. It was funny. Got back to the ship about 0100. Several buzz bombs
in London. Saw two from our train, flying low, angling to crash on London's
outskirts. These are more powerful than the old ones. Throw a hell of a
sheet of flame out when they explode. Liberty tonite, but I'm not going.
Andrews is, of course. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 21, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six letters from Betts today, four from Mom, plus
others. What a day. 1100, started loading up. A big gang of RAF ground
forces. 415 of 'em. Where will we put 'em. 1450 Underway.&nbsp; 1700 Anchored
off Southend. Underway again at midnite. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 22, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrived Ostende without incident at 1400.&nbsp;
Went ashore from 1830 to 1000. Heard small arms fire from the north part
of the city.&nbsp; Lots of collaborationists out there, districts are roped
off. They fire on any allied uniform they see.&nbsp; British are systematically
destroying their homes by blasting as punishment. had some beer &amp; ice
cream. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 23, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went ashore at 0900.&nbsp; Wandered around buying
souvenirs.&nbsp; Took trolley out to north part of city &amp; watched British
patrols cleaning snipers out of houses. British officer gave us hell &amp;
chased us out.&nbsp; Had more ice cream, bought a quart of champagne &amp;
came back to the ship.&nbsp; Underway at 1500 for Southhampton with 500
German prisoners &amp; snipers.&nbsp; 1100 Flying bombs overhead going
to London. Convoy firing. Exploded two. Several got thru. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 24, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrived I. of W. at 1300. Docked at Southhampton
hard at 1300 -- 2000 Prisoners unload, anchored off Calshot. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 25, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anchored as before. Liberty at 1600. Began painting ship
at 1300. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 26, 27, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still at anchor. Not going on liberty. Overhauled
2 generator engines. Ground the valves &amp; cleaned injectors. Not in
bad shape even after 2700 hrs duty. Went into S'hampton machine shop &amp;
visited with Chief Jim Harris, who went to school with me in Columbia,
Cleveland &amp; Solomons. Several buzzbombs over the nite of 27, high,
blown off their course to London. Watched nite fighters go after them in
the searchlites. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 28, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still at anchor. Working on generator engines.
Think I'll take the liberty tonite. Got an X-Mas pkg from home yesterday.
No mail for a week tho. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Oct. 29, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;Still at anchor. Nothing new. </font>

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 3, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000&nbsp; Arrived and anchored off LeHavre.&nbsp;
1500&nbsp; On the beach, at LeHavre waterfront.&nbsp; Went ashore on liberty
at 0500.&nbsp; The destruction here beats everything I've ever seen. Block
after block just rubble.&nbsp; Only the center of the town was relatively
unscathed.&nbsp; Everything else is blasted again and again. The people
here hate us. They claim the Germans weren't so bad.&nbsp; But we barbarians
destroyed France. To hell with them.&nbsp; They have about&nbsp; the same
brand of logic as a woman. There were 5000 Germans killed here ----- and
15,000 civilians. Liberty over at 2200.&nbsp; 2300 Underway. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 4, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underway for England.&nbsp; 1130 anchored at Calshot.&nbsp;

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 5, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anchored as before.&nbsp; 50 mile gale blowing.&nbsp;
Tried to get underway to go refuel, but too dangerous.&nbsp; Anchored again.
Quiet day. </font>

liberty.&nbsp; Ed Cordon and I went pub crawling.&nbsp; Had a swell time. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Nov. 8, 1944
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anchored as before. Nothing doing. Raining, so I
skipped liberty. That hour ride in a small boat, rough water breaking over
the side and a cold semi-gale makes liberty a rugged deal.&nbsp; But everyone
goes regardless.&nbsp; Guess I'll go in tomorrow and see "Story of Dr Wassell"&nbsp;
Mail today, I got one V-mail from Gram, dated Oct 26. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 9-10, 1944</i>

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 17, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1200 Arrived at Le Havre. Freighter ahead
hit a mine, ripped out her bottom.&nbsp; This harbor is full of sunken
ships.&nbsp; They are hooking pontoons alongside freighter pulling her
out of the channel to the beach, to save her cargo.&nbsp; God knows where
the mine came from.&nbsp; We are going in anyhow.&nbsp; 1700 beached, unloading
cargo. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 18, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0330&nbsp; Off the beach.&nbsp; Underway to Southhampton.&nbsp;
Forgot to mention. The channel has been wild as hell lately.&nbsp; Rain
&amp; gales all the time.&nbsp; Will be that way till March.&nbsp; What
a prospect.&nbsp; 1900 Arrived at Calshot and anchored. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 20, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anchored all day yesterday.&nbsp; Went on
liberty.&nbsp; Today we went into s-3 Hard at 1600.&nbsp; Not loading tonite,
so, off on liberty.&nbsp; In the rain as usual.&nbsp; Why hasn't this island
washed away, by now? </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 21, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loading up today.&nbsp; Green troops, some were
civilians on D-Day. Are they a bunch of misfits. Sure must be scraping
the barrel back home.&nbsp; Left s-3 Hard at 1700.&nbsp; Anchored off Calshot.&nbsp;

Beaching at 1700.&nbsp; See just the masts of that freighter sticking out.&nbsp;
T.S.&nbsp; Still no liberty -- damn it. I wanted to get some cosmetics
for the barmaid at the Richmond Inn.&nbsp; She fixes me up with Scotch
&amp; good ale when all the rest get only beer. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 23, 1944</i>

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 29, 1944</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underway at 0900.&nbsp; Going up the Seine River.&nbsp;
Very interesting scenery.&nbsp; All along the banks are wrecked vehicles,
tanks, staff cars, ambulances, carts etc. used by fleeing Germans, and
riddled by our planes.&nbsp; Several villages totally destroyed.&nbsp;
River very dangerous, mines thruout. Every so often masts &amp; funnels
of sunken ships projecting out of the water. Still we are going at battle
speed.&nbsp; 1300 Sighted wreckage of USS LST 6, sunk by a mine.&nbsp;
Several big freighters sunk, both by our planes before D-Day and by mines
afterward. 1800 Arrived at Rouen docks.&nbsp; Went out on liberty till
2300.&nbsp; Town crowded with troops. Found a cabaret, drank Calvados.&nbsp;
Inflation getting bad. 200 francs to an English pound is official rate
of exchange, but you can get up to 600 francs a pound. Prices sky high.
Stayed sober, good thing I did as the others got wild drunk on that Calvados.&nbsp;
Arrived at the ship O.K. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><i>Nov. 30, 1944--(note: Last Entry)</i>
