I</font></span><font size="1"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic"> 
actually have had some health problems this fall. Diagnosed with an early breast 
cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ. Had a lumpectomy (actually had to have a 
second one because they did not get enough first time). Next, I will have 33 
treatments of radiation beginning the end of Jan. This has all happened so 
fast......still seems unreal. All this was found in a routine 
mammogram..radiaologist found a very tiny white spec and called me back for an 
enlargement of the mammogram and it was actually five clusters. When these 
calcifications are clustered you must see a surgeon. Had a biopsy and that is 
when the diagnosis was made. So, here I am joining so many others with this damn 
cancer. But, my prognosis is very good, it is so early.&nbsp; </span></font>
