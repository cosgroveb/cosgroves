<center><b><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><font size=+4>Burns &amp; Casey--The
First Generations</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><font size=+3>In Waucoma &amp; Lawlor,
Iowa</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><font size=+3>Burns</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Gill Sans"><b>T</b>he Burnses are the precursors of the
Doyle part of our family. The first Burnses I have any knowledge of are
Owen Burns and Catherine Brennan Burns who were born in the early years
of the nineteenth century in a little village in Ulster. (Although Monaghan
is situated in the northern part of Ireland it is part of the Irish Republic.)</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Both were born in the parish of Maghleracloon
(pronounced mara cloon'), County Monaghan and married in 1835. They came
to the United States in 1838, just before the first of the tragic potato
famines in Ireland.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">In the Burn's family history written early this
century, there is brief mention of Owen's family. His mother's maiden name
was Cassidy; Owen Burns's father was one of 10 children, most of whom died
of TB. Even before the potatoes failed, lives were hard in Ireland.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Catherine Brennan Burns (great-great-great) was
born in the parish Magheracloon, County Monaghan in 1814, married Owen
in 1835, and died Christmas Day, 1889. Owen Burns was born April 1810,
County Monaghan, parish of Magherogloon and died in 1885, north of the
family homestead north of Waucoma, IA. It is interesting that Owen Burns,
our great grandmother's grandfather on her father's side and Patrick Casey,
her grandfather on her mother's side were born within two years of each
other in the same county in Ireland, but Patrick lived 30 years longer.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Our great-grand-mother Agnes Burns Doyle, was
the fifth of 13 children born to James Burns (Byrnes) and Catherine Casey
Burns. James Burns (great-great grandfather) was born in County Monaghan
in February 1837, and emigrated to Ohio with his parents at the age of
one (1838). The family first settled near Sandusky. In 1852, they came
overland and settled in Fayette County near Waucoma, Iowa.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">James Burns had one brother and three sisters.
Both Catherine Casey Burns and James Burns are buried in Lawlor, IA.</font>
<br><font face="Gill Sans">Historical note:</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Tom Fitzsimmons has e-mailed Kathleen and me
from Ireland with information about his great-grandmother, grandmother,
and father. Tom's grandfather Edward Fitzsimmons, married Kathryn Burnes
from Waucoma, around 1890. Kathryn (Catherine on baptismal certificate)
was born in 1869 and died of TB in Minneapolis in 1898. Her children (Claude
and a daughter who also died) were raised by a Mrs. M. A. Burns, in Lawlor.
Tom says this M. A. Burns was Kathryn's mother. If so, she could easily
have been the wife of James Burns's brother. Kathryn Burns was two years
older than our great-grandmother Mary Agnes Burns (Doyle). They could have
been cousins, and probably were.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">There is a photo of Dad around 1923, with his
mother, Kathleen, her mother Agnes Doyle, and her mother (Dad's Great Grandmother,
Catherine Casey Burns). A conversation with Uncle John makes me think it
was taken in East Davenport somewhere, although because of the setting,
I had at first thought it was taken in Waucoma.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><font size=+3>Caseys</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Gill Sans">Patrick Casey was the father of Catherine Casey
who married James Burns. He is our great-great-great grandfather: the grandfather
of Agnes Burns Doyle, the great-grandfather of our grandmother Kathleen
and her Doyle brothers and sisters. He was an obviously vigorous man who
lived to the ripe age of 103! He was born on March 17, 1812 in County Monaghan
and died June 4, 1915. Good to know there are some longevity genes in the
family. . . He married in Massachusetts at an early age and in 1854 came
west in a prairie schooner and purchased a farm in Chickasaw County, Iowa.
He fathered 7 children.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">We have a photo of Darrell, Conan, Larry, and
Kathleen Doyle, surrounding their great grandfather--probably taken around
1902, as Conan was an infant. Darrell Doyle's wife, Naoma, generously donated
this photo. Copies are available.</font>

<p><font face="Gill Sans">Mary Agnes Naoma was the 5th child of James and Catherine
Burns. She was the second child to live, as three older children died as
babies.&nbsp; Agnes's brothers &amp; sisters were:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;Edward (b. 1866)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;Mary Ann, Owen, Patrick, (all died in infancy),</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;Margaret (1873)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;Beatrice (1875)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;William &amp; John (twins, 1877)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;Genevieve (Sister Huberta, 1879)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;Manual (1881)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;Raymond (1882)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Gill Sans">&nbsp;Loretta (Sister Carmela, 1885)</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Gill Sans">The photo to the right is Catherine Casey Burns
with some of her children.&nbsp;</font><img SRC="ccaseychil3.jpg" height=306 width=386 align=RIGHT>
<br><font face="Gill Sans">Pictured: Genevieve (Sister Huberta 1879), and
Loretta (Sister Carmella 1885) and either Margaret (1873, Beatrice (1875)
or Agnes. The man: either William or John (twin 1877), Manual (1881) or
Raymond (1882).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Margaret Burns married Martin Qually and had
2 children, Kenneth and Virginia. Kathleen Doyle went to Mitchell, S. Dakota
to visit them as a young girl.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Beatrice and Raymond never married, and their
mother, Catherine, stayed with them and died in Avon, SD, in 1924, and
is buried in Lawlor, IA. (James Burns d. 1910).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Gill Sans">There is a photo of Agnes Doyle, her sisters
Margaret, Srs. Huberta and Carmella, picking grapefruit. This was during
a visit they made to Phoenix, AZ to their brother, "Uncle Will" Burns.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Picture below taken in the summer of 1923 (when
Dad a year and a half) or summer '24 when he was 2 and 1/2 with his great
grandmother Catherine Casey Burns. Dad's grandmother Agnes would have been
52 or 3; no birthdate on Catherine here. (She may have been born at least
by 1848. Her first child 1866--therefore possibly about 75 in this pic.)</font>
