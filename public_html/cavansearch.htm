<font face="Century Gothic">Kathleen Cosgrove Lewis &amp; Moira Cosgrove
Pate (great grandnieces of Bishop Henry Cosgrove) went to Ireland during
the summer of 1998. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Our beginning was in Cavan, looking for a thread
to connect us to the Bishop's parents. At this time, we did not know where
in Cavan the Bishop's parents were born &amp; lived. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Our first stop--a wild guess--was in Ballyjamesduff.
This small village supposedly was the home of some emigrating Cosgroves
in the late 19th century. All the phonebook Cosgroves here are related
to the same family. A local gave us directions to the "homeplace", a white
farmhouse on the corner of nowhere. Mrs. Patrick Cosgrove, a longtime widow,
was very sweet, invited us in, and proved she knew little of her husband's
family. Her own many children are scattered, a girl in America and a son
in London. As he may know something, and is a solicitor, we will contact
him.

<br>We went to Cavan City second, to talk to Fr.
Gerard Alwill, principal at the boys' school at St. Patrick's College.
Webmaster. We had already e-mailed Fr. Gerry, who had promised to "have
a word with the historians at the college". The historian, the Bishop of
Cavan, seemed not to believe that WE had a bishop, however remotely, from
Cavan that he didn't know about. We got the grand tour of St. Patrick's,
a once prosperous school, that is now fallen on hard times and is heading
to a close. Fr. Alwill gave us the name of a priest historian to contact
(who turned out to be in a conference in London). Another dead-end. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Our B &amp; B was run by a friendly woman with
wild red hair whose husband worked with the genealogy people at Cana House
in Cavan on genealogy projects: Ben Gaffney. He had mapped the old cemetery
near Ballyjamesduff. I can't remember if the stones from that cemetery
were transcribed (I think not, or we would have followed up.) All over
Ireland people are beginning to do this, but it is a tremendous job and
there is little funding for it. Also, removing the lichen and moss subjects
the grave markers to further weather damage, but if you don't, they are
almost impossible to read. Ben explained to us the scarcity of records
in Ireland for the time before the famine. The churches themselves have
only patchy marriage and death records and most people were too poor for
headstones. He recommended that we go to Cana House; they have in their
database all the records that are left in the county. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Cana House told us that their records consist
of only some parishes in Cavan; the rest are lost. Cana produced baptismal
records for only two James Cosgroves in the period 1795 - 1820, both born
1814: one James Cosgrife of Henry Cosgrife and Anne Smith (sponsors: James
Cosgrife &amp; Mary Kelcher) and James Cosgriff of Henry Cosgriff and Mary
Smith (sponsors Henry Cosgriff &amp; Mary Smith). In those days, everyone
we spoke to assured us, the spelling varied according to whichever priest
or estate official wrote the names down. Another search yielded a John
Cosgriff b. 1813 of Terence Cosgriff and Mary Doyle (sponsors: James Reilly
and Catherine Coyle); John Cosgrove b. 1819 at Castlerahan Parish of Terence
Cosgrove and Nora Reilly (sponsors: John Brody and Catherine Cumskey) Address:
Carnin; and John Cosgrive b. 1815 of unknown Cosgrive and Bridget Maguire
(sponsors: Edward Brady and Mary O'Bryan). Unless otherwise mentioned all
the above were from Cavan Parish with an unknown address. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">No record of our ancestor John, born in 1808. </font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic">Without a marriage record from the US, or exact
place or birth in Ireland, we are at a dead end on Cosgroves. </font>
<p><b><i><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">2006 note: Because of some e-mails 
we have received, we now believe John Cosgrove and at least 2 brothers came to 
the U.S. from Ballyjamesduff.</font></i></b><p>
