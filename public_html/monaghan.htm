<p><font face="Gill Sans">Our start in Monaghan began in Carrickmacross.
This is the nearest town to the parish of Magheracloone where all three
of our great-great-greats began life: James Casey, Owen Burnes and Catherine
Brennan. We searched in vain for a tourist center, but found the Chamber
of Commerce/Community Center where Kevin Gartlan began pointing us in the
right direction.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">He gave us the parish map of Magheracloone, which
contained the townlands, the location of three cemetaries and the roads
winding through it. Parishes were divided in the old days into "townlands"
of various sizes--some no larger than 50 acres, some well over 100. There
are civil, RC and Church of Ireland parishes, all with approximately the
same boundaries. In each parish there may be more than one church and more
than one cemetary.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">In Magheracloone there are two RC churches, and
one centrally located Church of Ireland. This one, St. Molua's, had the
oldest cemetary surrounding it, which contained both RC and Cof E graves,
some dating back to the 1700's.</font>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Monaghan has a privately run geneology center,
and the fellow there is so overburdened with a backlog of requests he wouldn't
see anyone. Kevin suggested a knowledgeable priest to us, who was on holiday.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">The library at Carrickmacross had a history of
Monaghan and a history of the Shirleys in Ireland. This pitiful library
had a broken copier, few books, but a most helpful librarian, who showed
us what she could and called the county library in Clones for us, where
we made an appointment for the next day.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Our most interesting and most informal history
source was a little Irishman whose eyes actually twinkled. Linus McDonnell,
pub owner, amateur historian and great walker entertained and shocked us
with his stories--all punctuated with winks, asides and theatrical gestures.
He is the one who described the infamous Shirley landowners and explained
the ways in which the English landlords maintained their iron grip on the
Irish population during the 18th and 19th centuries.</font>

<p><font face="Gill Sans">Lands in Ireland were awarded by the English
Crown to rough soldiers and other coarse individuals who won in battle
or performed other services to the King. They were not the aristocrats
we associate with English nobility. The sources we read indicated that
they were often bitterly disappointed when they got to Ireland and found
how poor their lands, tenants and shabby manor houses were, and how isolated
and unimproved the country was. Of course, the lands they were given already
belonged to someone--many Irish someones, who overnight became tenants.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Magheracloone today appears pastoral and green--rolling
land, sheep, vistas that remind us of central Kentucky, northern Iowa or
Illinois. No rivers, mountains, grand lakes or ruined castles. It is pleasant
and just short of charming.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">The Shirleys were, according to one book we read,
among the worst landlords in Ireland. Linus related stories that were horrifying.
He said they always, not sometimes but always for over a hundred years,
exercised their so-called "right" of first night: they got the new bride
right after the wedding. Husbands, fathers or brothers who occasionally
protested were killed or maimed, one bride was tied by her hair to a horse
and dragged to her death. Linus said that in spite of the fact the English
did everything to wipe out the records of the Irish, deny them schooling
and wipe out the language and the church, the stories are nonetheless still
passed down.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">The penal laws were repealed in 1798, after the
"risings" of 1798 that were being commemorated all over Ireland while we
we there. These laws denied the Irish the right to own or inherit land,
attend school, speak Gaelic, or practice Roman Catholicism. This fact alone
contributes to the sketchiness of the records and the few remaining gravestones.
In addition of course, most Irish practicing Catholics had become very
poor. Irish had no recourse to law.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">The Shirleys apparently were considered poor
landlords by the history texts for other reasons than their appalling behavior.
When they took over, many of their "tenants" had owned substantial acreage.
The Irish, unlike the English, divided the land equally among the sons.
So a family owning 100 acres in 1750, may have had many descendents each
owning only 5 -10 acres by the turn of the century. In fact by the early
years of the famine, the Shirleys "assisted emigration" by booking passage
to Australia, Canada and America for large numbers of their tenants. This
was not a generous gesture. If they were able to get the tenants to leave,
the Shirleys could redistribute the land. "Plantation" is the term for
bringing over Scottish and English farmers to "plant" the Irish estates
taken from evicted or emigrated Irish. A two acre holding by a fellow with
five children to feed was not profitable to the Shirleys. The tenant couldn't
pay his potato tithe. If 40 or 50 such small time sharecroppers left, the
Shirleys could get someone to take over who could pay the tithe.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Our great-greats left before the famine and were
not part of the assisted emigration. The records of the assisted emigration
were published in the Breffni Journal. (Monaghan was once the Kingdom of
Breffni, as part of Cavan was once the Kingdom of Offaly). Linus told us
that at one time, the old (earl?) Shirley would allow vistors to look at
the Shirley Estate records. Since the new person inherited, the records
were sent to Belfast.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">There are no parish (birth, marriage or death)
records for Magheracloone from the time we are interested in (pre 1840).</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">The Clones library has microfilm of tithe records
of 1824-30. These are supposed to list under each parish, by townland,
the holdings of each tenant. Of the (about) 86 townlands in Magheracloone,
we found 31 townlands that contained a Byrnes, Casey, Brennan or Cassidy.
Our Owen Byrnes was born in 1810, Patrick Casey in 1812, and Catherine
Brennan in 1814. We hoped when we placed all the holdings on the map, that
we would find an area where these three family names were concentrated
and that might give us a clue. Well, so much for pipedreams. There are
records of 47 holdings belonging to a Byrnes. Many of the names were the
same, and we wondered if one person might own scattered acreage. Most people
in Ireland who know anything assured us this was probably not the case.
I am not completely convinced. There is a Catherine Byrnes, widow, who
has three small holdings, and I still believe that is probably one person.
Nonetheless, there are many many Byrneses, all probably related to each
other in some way. In the absence of birth or death records we will never
know. Kathleen has copied some records of priests' names from this parish,
perhaps that will shed slightly more light.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">The Cassidys are easiest to trace. In the townland
of Feahoe, three of them owned 78 acres.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Caseys are found only in the townland of Clonminon
(three with 35 acres)</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Assorted Brennans owned 14 acres in Clontrain,
five a. in Derrynaghlaghe, 20 a. in Derryleeg.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">At some point in the future I will scan the map
of the parish and write in the names where the assorted Byrnes, Caseys,
Cassidys and Brennans scraped a living.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">We found two gravestones of Byrneses in St. Molua's;
one commemorates 4 or more--was very hard to read-- and one erected for
a beloved daughter who died at 22. Kathleen has copied those and I will
include the writing at a later date. In light of the many many Byrneses
in the area, I can only conclude we were too poor for headstones.</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">We have not attempted to find our Doyle ancestor
from the parish of Tramore in Wexford or his wife Mary Goilsdan from Nenagh
in Tipperary. Although we were near Nenagh, a geneological search is 50
Lbs. and we don't have the parish info...Next time!</font>
<p><font face="Gill Sans">Our conclusion is: we have made no conclusions.
We will probably next go to Dubuque and Waucoma and continue where we should
have begun! We'll compose a synopsis of our trip next and send it along,
with photos scanned in. I will create another version of this in .html
with color pictures of the areas later in the week, and send it along if
you can open it!</font>
