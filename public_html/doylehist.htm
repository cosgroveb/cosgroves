<p>The year 1993 has seen six generations of James Doyle’s progeny in America. 
As new Doyle's are born and old Doyle's die, our ancestor’s histories are 
gradually forgotten. Tombstones remain, but the memories of the lives of those 
buried beneath them fade into obscurity with each succeeding generations. Family 
stories become confused. Interpretations of what really happened are as 
different as the individuals telling them. For the sake of genealogy, facts are 
relied upon. Birth certificates, marriage licenses, naturalization papers, 
wills, etc. must be traced and recorded. In an effort to assure that the Doyle 
history not be forgotten, the information found in this booklet has been traced 
and recorded. Included are some stories, some historical dates and events to 
give the reader a better idea of the world as seen by our ancestors, and some 
memories of those who have departed.</p>
<p>As the world become ever more complicated in our approach to the 21<sup>st</sup> 
century, a few moments every so often to reflect upon who we are, where we came 
from, the problems that our ancestors faced, the happy and sad times they 
experienced, gives each of us a greater sense of self identity and better 
appreciation of our own lives and the circumstances surrounding them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">DOYLE ANCESTORS IN IRELAND</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>
<p>On or about 1000 A.D. a young Norwegian Viking, holding his horned helmet 
stood on the deck of his fierce looking ship as it sailed out of the Irish Sea 
and edged into the Bay of Tramore in southern Ireland. The young Viking had 
joined the expedition seeking excitement and fortune. Thus he was eager to catch 
his first glimpse of the Viking settlement of Waterford where he was to call 
home.</p>
<p>They called him Dubh-ghall, meaning dark foreigner. In the gaelic language 
this was written O’Dubhghaill and later, simply Doyle.</p>
<p>We can reasonably conjecture that our ancestor settled in Waterford and 
accepted the Irish customs and ways as so many Norsemen did. He probably married 
an Irish woman and began a long line of the Doyle family.</p>
<p>The Doyles settled in East Waterford in the electoral division of Pembrook in 
the town of Cullen Castle located in the Barony of Middlethird in the Parish of 
Tramore. </p>
<p>Doyle ancestors would have witnessed the turbulence of the 1160’s and 70’s. 
In ll54 when King Henry II of England acceded to the throne, an Englishman, 
Nicholas Breakspear became Pope Adrian IV. The Pope regarded himself as the 
sovereign lord of Ireland and all islands surrounding her. (This right comes 
from the Donation of Constantine).</p>
<p>Under the pretense of lax morality in Ireland, Pope Adrian encouraged King 
Henry II to invade her. Finally, the Pope granted outright hereditary possession 
of Ireland to England. At this time, Dermot MacMurrough of Leinster sought the 
kingship of Ireland. In his quest he invited the Earl of Pembroke – called 
Strongbow – to help him.</p>
<p>The first Norman invaders landed in Wexford in 1169. After Wexford was taken, 
Strongbox landed in Waterford and proceeded to take it. Doyle ancestors surely 
were involved in these confrontations.</p>
<p>Strongbow conquered Waterford and built a fortress which still stands today 
as a reminder of the English invasions. Because of these battles, King Henry II 
ruled Dublin, Waterford and Wexford.</p>
<p>Following this first English invasion of Ireland were centuries more of 
England trying to aanihilate the Irish race. Donal O’Neill wrote that the murder 
of the Irishman was not a felony, and &quot;it is no more sin, say even some of their 
religious, to kill an Irishman than to kill a dog&quot;.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous invasion was in 1649 when the dreaded Oliver 
Cromwell landed in Dublin with 17,000 Puritan army troops and proceeded to 
massacre the Irish ‘papists’ (Catholics) in the name of God. The Irish who 
weren’t killed were exiled or sent into slavery. Five sixths of the population 
perished under Cromwell. </p>
<p>In 1652 and 1653, a plague killed even more Irish.</p>
<p>In 1653, the English Parliament declared that all fertile lands in Ireland 
were to become the property of Cromwell’s soldiers or Protestants. In the same 
year, the English conducted a Civil Survey. We are fortunate to have a copy 
showing the Doyle farmland in Cullen Castle.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="baronymiddlethird.gif" width="729" height="439"></p>
<p>Cromwell’s Census of 1654 above</p>
<p>In 1654, the Doyle's would have been tenants of James Bryver, protestant. 
(Note that James’ father, Francis, was a papist. We can only guess that James 
declared himself a protestant in order to keep his land. This was a common 
practice at the time.)</p>
<p>In 1685, the Catholic King James II ascended to the throne of England and 
restored most of the rights back to the Irish. William of Orange – a Puritan – 
shortly thereafter attacked England and declared himself king. James II fled to 
France. The Irish raised an army and invited James II to Ireland to assist him 
back to the throne. On September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1689, the Irish succumbed to 
William. In that same year, the infamous Penal Laws were passed by the English 
parliament. </p>
<p>The Penal Laws forbade the Irish Catholics from receiving education, entering 
a profession, holding public office, engaging in trade, living within five miles 
of a town, owning a house of greater value than five pounds, from leasing land, 
voting or keeping arms. They even prohibited Irish Catholics from engaging in 
worship or being guardians to their own children.</p>
<p>It was during this era when Michael Doyle was born --- c1775. In 1776 (86 
years after the Penal Laws went into effect), Lord Charlemont presented a bill 
to the House of Lords to make it lawful for the Catholic to lease a cabin and 
potato garden. He was dubbed a ‘papist’ and voted out of his chair for such an 
infamous proposal. </p>
<p>Finally, in 1793, an Act was passed relieving the Catholics of their 
disabilities – in theory at least. It was another 36 years, 1829, before the Act 
– known as Catholic Emancipation – was realized thanks to the agitation of 
Daniel O’Connell.</p>
<p>Michael Doyle had at least one son named Walter who was born c1800. A 
marriage record located in the parish church of Tramore indicates that Walter 
married Johanna Arregon on January 11, 1825. They lived during the time of 
Daniel O’Connell’s prominence in Ireland. In 1834, O’Connell allowed the Whig 
government to try and six year experiment in governing Ireland in exchange for 
letting the Repeal Act for which he fought so hard, go into abeyance.</p>
<p>During the six year experiment the Whigs passed the Tithes Act which 
increased rents from Catholics in Ireland by 75%. The Tithes Acts made evictions 
commonplace. It appears that the Doyle's were able to remain on their land.</p>
<p>The young Doyle family lived in relatively peaceful times from a political 
view, but in dire economic times.</p>
<p>Potatoes were easily grown. They were the only crop that would allow a family 
to survive on their small land holdings. Combined with milk they provided all of 
Ireland with a nourishing diet. Potatoes were the mainstay of the Irish diet. 
Dr. E.R.R. Green, Course of the Irish History, sums up the economic conditions 
of the time:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
</b><font SIZE="3">
    <p>&quot;The figures from the 1841 census reveal the appalling insecurity of 
    Ireland’s vast population. Only 7% of holdings were over thirty acres in 
    size. 45% were under five. ---- over two thirds of the Irish people were 
    dependent on agriculture for a livelihood in 1841. There had also been a 
    severe deflation of Irish money. The survival of a vast impoverished 
    population depended on the recurring fruitfulness of the potato and on that 
    alone.&quot;</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</font><b>
<p>Nothing of the scale of the 1845 potato blight had ever happened in Ireland 
before, and nobody was prepared for the magnitude of the disaster. Though its 
nature was unknown at the time, the blight was due to a fungus that spread 
incredibly swiftly, causing the entire crop to be inedible. </p>
<p>The GREAT HUNGER followed.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="hunger.jpg" width="392" height="437" align="left"></p>
<p>Walter Doyle was 45 years old. Accounts of the Irish Famine are numerous and 
one is as horrible as the other. Stories of walking skeletons, dogs eating 
corpses. &quot;Slip Coffins&quot; which were used to bury the dead had hinges on the 
bottom which allowed the body to &quot;slip&quot; into the grave so that the coffin might 
be re-used.</p>
<p>Because it was impossible to pay rents to their absentee English landlords, 
thousands of Irish tenants were thrown out of their houses. </p>
<p>The English parliament, under Queen Victoria in 1846 passed a Coercion Bill, 
which was devised to protect English landlords from being set upon by the 
starving Irish. Among other stipulations, no Irishman could appear outside his 
house from sundown to sunrise. Many Irish fled Ireland, mostly to America and 
Canada. Between 1841 and 1851, Ireland lost two and one half million people 
either from starvation or migration. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="emigrating.gif" width="445" height="328" align="right"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Those who could, escaped the Famine by emigrating – many to America. This 
group waits on the quay, surrounded by their belongings, for a boat to take them 
to a new life on the other side of the Atlantic.</i></p>
<p>Walter Doyle had at least the following children: </p>
<p>James, Kathryn, Louise, Maria, Thomas, and John.</p>
<p>One can imagine the reoccupation of feeding eight dependents with little food 
or money. Something had to be done. Emigration was their only choice. James was 
the first to leave. The Doyle's probably followed the Irish custom of holding a 
‘living wake’ for James. Friends and relatives would have been invited for an 
all night mock wake to bid their goodbyes. </p>
<p>It must have been a bittersweet ordeal for Walter and Johannah to know that 
they would never see their son again but at the same time his future in America 
was far better than in Ireland.</p>
<p>The following pages are copies of various census of Ireland: 1845, 1868 and 
1901. They show the succession of the Doyle farm. Please note that in 1845, 
Michael and Walter Doyle are listed as the Heads of Household. In 1868, John 
Doyle (son of Walter) is farming the land and in 1901, Michael Doyle (son of 
John Doyle) is Head of Household. </p>
<p>Doyle's reside in the house to this day. Also note that they farmed 34 acres 
and the house consisted of a thatched cottage of five rooms with five windows in 
the front of the house and seven outbuildings. (This was a sizable farm to be 
leased and would account for the family legend that the Doyle's quite better off 
than most immigrants.)</p>

<p>In 1848, James Doyle, age 15, set sail for Quebec, Canada. He was accompanied 
by Martin Doyle, age 33 (perhaps an uncle) and maybe more of his family. They 
lived in Canada for one year prior to moving to Vermont in 1849. </p>
<p>America was in a ‘boom’ economy in 1849. The Mexican-American War had just 
ended. Zachary Taylor was voted in as President. Gold was discovered in 
California. Minnesota became a Territory.</p>
<p>In 1846, the sewing machine was invented which reduced the time for making a 
shirt from 14 hours to one hour. The telegraph had just been invented and John 
Deere Co. of Moline, Illinois invented a plow which helped open up farmland 
throughout the Midwest. By 1850 John Deere was turning out 10,000 blows a year.
</p>
<p>James married Mary Flannery in 1854 in Vermont. Mary was born in 1833 in nana 
of County Tipperary, Ireland. They gave birth to Johanna and James in Vermont.</p>
<p>Martin Doyle married Bridget Connan and also had a son named David. </p>
<p>In 1859, Abraham Lincoln debated the slave issue in his bid to be elected 
President in 1860. It appeared that war between the states was inevitable. The 
Civil War began with the attack on Fort Sumpter in 1861.</p>
<p>In 1858, James, Mary, Johanna, and James Jr., along with Margaret Flannery 
and her son Patrick (mother and brother of Mary Flannery Doyle), moved to 
Chicago and then to Warren, Jo Davies County, Illinois where they found 
employment on the Davenport and Northwestern Railway. They were accompanied by 
Martin Doyle and his family.</p>

<p>As western expansion continued, more and more immigrants sought available 
farmlands. Apparently, James Doyle also wanted to avail himself of the 
opportunity to purchase land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Mary Elizabeth Doyle Burke (Bessie), her grandparents, James and 
Mary Doyle and their family traveled in a covered wagon from Warren, Illinois to 
the Mississippi river in December of 1864. They had to wait until the river was 
frozen in order to cross. They crossed at Sabula, Iowa on New Years Eve. From 
there they proceeded to Waucoma where James obtained a job with the Davenport 
and Northwestern Railway.</p>
<p>i<img border="0" src="landiniowa.gif" width="477" height="658" align="left"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="covwagon.gif" width="415" height="256" align="right"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1868, James, at age 35, was able to purchase 160 acres of government 
farmland and take up farming on Section 21, Eden Township, Waucoma in Fayette 
County, Iowa.</p>
<p>James and Mary had nine living children: James, Patrick, Edward, Frank, 
Johanna, Margaret, Bridget, Mary and Anastasia. In addition, three of their 
children died in infancy: Walter, Catherine and Walter.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of the Reconstruction Era when James purchased his farm. 
The Civil War had ended. Ulyssis S. Grant was voted in as President. The &quot;North&quot; 
was in a boom economy. Much of the country was dependent on the &quot;breadbasket’ of 
the world for food. The expansion to the West was in full progress as 
territories became States. Nebraska had just become a state. Native American 
Indians were being forced into reservations making settlement of the West safer.</p>
<p>James and Mary lived a peaceful and prosperous life in Iowa. For James it 
must have been a dream come true. In just twenty years he saw the difference 
between his family dying of starvation in Ireland and himself becoming the owner 
of 160 acres of prosperous farmland in America.</p>

<br>Back in Ireland the post famine years saw the emergence of organised
opposition to the large landed estates. Again the Doyles played a role
in this period. Michael Doyle of Tagoat in Wexford was an active Land Leaguer
during the 1880s, and sat upon the first G.A.A. committee in that county.
This Michael was also the father of Canon Patrick Doyle, a parish priest
of Ferns and later President of the renowned St Peter's College in Wexford.
Reverand Thomas Doyle, parish priest of Ramsgrange Co.Wexford between 1863-1903,
proved a fearless champion of tenant farmers during eviction days. When
the Land Act of 1881 was mooted, the Freeman's Journal continually urged
the Irish people to accept it. In this period a Canon Doyle emerged as
the greatest advocate of this legislation. He urged the Irish to:
<br>"..extract every atom of good you can out of it, seize on every point
of vantage it offers on which a new battery can be planted to assail the
fortress of landlordism, and smash it into fragments"
<br>This proved to be good and sound advice as events turned out.
