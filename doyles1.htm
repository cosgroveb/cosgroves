<img border="0" src="jasdoyle2.jpg" width="477" height="682" align="left">Mary Agnes Burns (b. 1/12/1871 d. 12/26/52) married Edward Doyle in
1893. Ed's father was James Doyle (our great-great grandfather). James
Doyle was born in the parish of Tramore, County Waterford in 1833. (according
to Judy Waters "Roots") He came to Quebec in 1848, one year later moved
to Rutland, Vermont. There he married Mary in 1848. In 1858 they went to
Chicago by covered wagon. This story had James I's wife as Mary Goilsdon.
<br>Another account (probably the right one), from The Doyle Family History
that the Waucoma Branch worked on, has Great Great Grandma Doyle's name
as Mary Flannery. She came to the US with her mother Margaret and brother
Patrick after her father, a professor, died in Ireland. She married James
in Vermont, had two children, lived briefly in Warren, IL, (Jo Davies County)
had another child, then they came west to Waucoma in a covered wagon. Her
brother went off to serve in the Civil War and was never heard from again,
according to this account. </span></font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><span style="font-size: 11pt">James died in 1905 and Mary in 1917. They are buried in Waucoma.
</span></font>

Maria Doyle Murphy. He had one brother, Thomas Doyle. </span></font>

Jimmy&nbsp; Doyle and Walter Doyle.&nbsp; Johanna Shoemaker lived in Alaska.
Mame Kieran (Kieron?) lived in Waucoma her whole life in a corner house
across the street from Dewey Chisek. Her husband died early in life, and
she had a son&nbsp; James who taught in Clermont. He committed suicide.
