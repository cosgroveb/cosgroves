weeks. The following day's article headlined: Cosgrove's Body Found in

body of Joseph Cosgrove was found in the river Friday evening at 7:30 o'clock, 
confirming the fear that he had ended his life by jumping into the river. Three 
small boys who were fishing near the foot of Farnum Street made the discovery. 
They noticed something big floating in the river some distance from where they 
were fishing and investigation proved it to be the body of a man. By fastening a 
rope over the body, the boys were able to bring the body to shore and Halligan's 
undertaking parlors was notified&quot;. . The body was interred at St. Marguerite's, 
&quot;Rev. M.M. O'Laughlin officiating.&nbsp; It is thought that the passing of a steamer 
near the place where young Cosgrove leaped into the river on Tuesday night, 
April 21, stirred the river to such an extent that the body was loosened from 
its resting place and floated to the top. The body was found about 600 feet west 
of where he was supposed to have jumped into the river.&quot; The article goes on to 
say he had been educated in parochial schools, was &quot;well-thought of&quot;, and was

recollections are of when we lived on Dover Court near Vanderveer Park. Mom &amp; 
Dad frequently went to the Elks Club and my brother Tom age 15 or 16 babysat 
with me and was always changing the time on the clocks so he could get me to bed 
earlier. A cute girl lived next door and he'd sneak over there and keep her 
company when she babysat her younger brother. I remember several times that he 
hid in the bushes and scratched the window. Then she'd call him to come over and 
keep her company. Sometimes he'd bring me over and put me on the living room 
couch to read, and they'd go to the kitchen, play music on the radio and dance.</font></span></i></p>

Clinton Doyles all got together for big dinners at Gallaghers' at 7th and Iowa. 
(They lived downstairs in an apartment.) All the aunts had their chores--Esther 
was in charge of peas, Dolores was mashed potatoes, and Kathleen, gravy. My dad, 
Jack, always carved the bird! At Thanksgiving, we always had turkey notes and 
the grandchildren made these and we all had some good laughs--I still remember

regular visits to the Cosgroves on Dover Court for conversations or cards for 
the grownups while we rummaged upstairs in Tommy's room, reviewing his comic 
book collection or playing tag in their backyard. I remember Uncle Jack, usually 
in his undershirt, (barefooted during the hot fall Sunday afternoons), listening 
to the Bears games on the radio. There was usually a lot of laughing (at what?), 
amid whatever gossip came to mind when we bothered to listen. I don't know of 
any other families who enjoyed humor so much as those micks. Dolores and Agnita 
always had a new joke to share while the menfolk sprinkled their reminiscences 
with jests or salty language for amusing effect. Jack, Gallagher and Larry were 
all salesmen who collected anecdotes to share with customers and family alike.</font></span></i></p>
