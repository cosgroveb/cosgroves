<font size=+1 face="Century Gothic">The Cosgrove story really got its
start in Iowa. As the Irish landed in the United States, they were all
intrigued by the opportunity for land in the new territories. Bishop Loras
described his diocese of Dubuque in glowing terms and advertised for settlers
in Catholic newspapers and by letter to his old acquaintances.</font></b><font face="Century Gothic"><b>

68 of a stroke July 10, 1884, one day before her son Henry was elevated to

Patrick's sons emigrated. Probably Andrew Cosgrove who died in 1867 was also 
John's brother. (His sister was Mrs. Sheridan, who may have been John's sister

<font face="Century Gothic" style="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Obituary - Cosgrove - At a quarter past 12 o'clock 
a.m. yesterday, the venerable mother of the Very Rev. Henry Cosgrove of this 
city, passed into the eternal rest for which she was so well prepared by a life 
of piety that was marked with obedience to the divine injunction: &quot;do good unto 
others.&quot;&nbsp; Mrs. Cosgrove was born in Ireland in 1816 and was 68 years of age at 
the time of her death.&nbsp; Her maiden name was Bridget Kane.&nbsp; She became the wife 
of James Cosgrove [typo?] when a young woman.&nbsp; In 1830 Mr. and Mrs. Cosgrove 
emigrated to this country and settled in Williamsport, Pa., where Father 
Cosgrove was born in 1834.&nbsp; In 1838 the[y] removed to Holldoysburg [sp], Pa., 
where the family remained until 1845, when they removed to Dubuque.&nbsp; Their home 
was in that city until about the year 1867, when Mr. Cosgrove came to Davenport, 
where his son had been priest for ten years, for medical treatment, and here he 
died. The next year Mrs. Cosgrove and her children removed to this city to be 
near the elder son, who was fulfilling all her hopes in the service of the 
church. Here she has had a happy home near him ever since - bright, cheerful, 
intelligent, and excellent company in her social circle.&nbsp; Last winter she was 
stricken with paralysis, severely, but from this she partly recovered.&nbsp; Two 
weeks ago, a second attack prostrated her - and she lingered in a feeble 
condition, the subject of the most faithful attentions of her reverend son and 
the other children, until death came.&nbsp; Her children who survive her are:&nbsp; The 
Very Rev. Henry, John, James in Davenport; Mrs. John [should be Pat] Murray of 
Fonda, Iowa, Mrs. Mary Roche in Davenport, Sister Mary Regina, B.V., in Clinton, 
Iowa and Miss Theresa, whose house has been with her mother. The funeral takes 
place to-morrow (Monday) morning, with services in St. Marguerite's cathedral at 
9 o'clock.&quot;</font></p>

<span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">Thanks to the 
Sisters of Charity, we have information about <b>Sister Regina</b>: Sister of 
Henry Cosgrove, Bishop of Davenport</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<span style="font-size:11pt;
font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">Sr. Regina, BVM, was born in Williamsport in 
1838; her name was Ellen Cosgrove. She entered the Sisters of Charity of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary at Dubuque at age 15 (9/8/53). She was the 57<sup>th</sup> 
member of the order. She was one of the pioneer sisters at Ft. Dodge in 1862.&nbsp; 
They departed by train from Dubuque to Cedar Rapids where they engaged a stage</span><font face="Century Gothic"><span style="font-size:11pt">
</span></font>
<span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:
&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">coach. They traveled all night on Wednesday until 9:30 p.m. 
Thursday when they arrived in Fort Dodge &quot;' all safe, all well, and all in good 
spirits&quot; as Father Marsh the pastor at Corpus Christi reported.&quot; Sister Regina 
was considered to be very talented in art and therefore, according to the policy 
of the Sisterhood, was rotated through many of their schools. They tried to have 
their teachers of great ability teach as many places as possible to &quot;scatter 
their light.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<span style="font-size:11pt;
font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">In 1867, she taught art, music and embroidery 
at ICA 
in Davenport, as well as many other locations in Iowa: 
Davenport, Clinton, Ft. Dodge, Council Bluffs. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<span style="font-size:11pt;
font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">She died on February 28, 
1889 and is buried in St. Joseph's 
Cemetary, Council Bluffs. Sister Regina's obituary in the Davenport 
Democratic-Gazette stated: &quot;She had a rare talent for music and drawing--became 
an artist of remarkable talent with pencil and brush. . .The deceased was of a 
most amiable disposition, and had greatly endeared herself to all outside 
acquaintances as well as to members of the order and pupils in her charge.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-weight: 700">Speculations about 
the Bishop’s relatives in religious orders and their relation to us:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">Sr. Regina had two 
cousins also members of the order. Sister Mary Jerome Cosgrove (#69 in Order. 
She was born named Catherine in Cavan in 1832-- parents unknown, and entered the 
order in Dubuque in 1854.&nbsp; Sr. Mary Francis Mulligan, #33, also born in Cavan, 
in 1834; died 1895. She entered the order in 1849 in Philadelphia. The cousins 
must be daughters of one or more of John's (Henry's father) brothers. I believe 
John must have had a brother named Patrick Cosgrove. Patrick is the 
great-grandfather of Sr. Lorraine Tierney, who is called Sr. Regina's grand 
niece by the Sisters of Charity. She could not really be the great-niece of Sr. 
Regina, she would be a cousin three times removed!! Patrick who remained in 
Ireland would have been the Regina's uncle, Patrick in Cherokee her cousin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">Cherokee Patrick is 
the great-grandfather also of Janet Martin with whom we have corresponded. (Her 
father was Frank, grandfather John.) Leo Cosgrove was the son of Michael 
Cosgrove and grandson of Patrick.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">Michael Cosgrove 
was born in Moher New Innes, Ballyjamesduff, Cavan in 1847. His parents were 
Patrick and Ann Smith Cosgrove who stayed in Ireland. Patrick could have been 
born in the 1820's, making it possible that he was the brother of John Cosgrove 
(the Bishop's father). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">Patrick and Ann had 
9 children: Peter (1842-1909; came to US first), Catherine (m. John Denien), 
James stayed in Ireland, Michael, Patrick married Anna Carroll, Bridget, Henry 
(came to Cherokee), John ( settled in Cherokee this would be grandfather of 
Janet Martin, died 1923) and Ann (died in infancy). Michael emigrated in 1864 to 
Manchester IA, where Peter was, he died in Meriden, Cherokee County, IA in 1930. 
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">Michael was 15 and 
13 years younger than the two Sisters of Charity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">Michael had a son 
named Leo and lived in Cherokee, Iowa. His wife Phyllis was 82 in 1998, and has 
written us with this information.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">Patrick married 
Anna Carroll, had a son John (d. 1923) who had a son Frank, father of Janet 
Martin. John also had a daughter Anna who was the mother of Sister Lorraine 
Tierney. John Cosgrove was Lorraine's grandfather, Patrick her 
great-grandfather. This Patrick who is her great grandfather, would have to be 
the son of the Patrick who stayed in Ireland. The Cherokee Iowa Patrick would be 
the cousin of the Bishop and of Sr. Regina, his uncle the father of the Bishop.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">The nuns Catherine 
and Mary Francis were born in the 1830s too old to be Ireland Patrick's 
daughters; therefore, if they are Bishop Henry's cousins, they are daughters of 
another brother of John Cosgrove.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-family: Century Gothic"><font size="2">Sr. Regina's 
great-niece is a member of the order, still living at Wright Hall in Chicago. 
(As of 1998) She is Sr. Lorraine Tierney.&nbsp; Lorraine was born May 31, 1916.

When my grandmother went off to 
college in 1915 or so, she went to Clark College in Dubuque and I have a letter 
her dad wrote to her telling her he was enclosing some money for her so she 
could go shopping with &quot;Aunt Tessie.&quot; So at that time Tom and Tessie were in 
Dubuque. Tom seems to have gotten around. He was always on the move. He married 
Theresa in 1887, which is right around the time he was in this business in 
Waterloo (it was a &quot;railroad eating house&quot;). He probably met Theresa when the 
family was up there, or she was visiting them from Davenport.</i></span></p>

As I say, sometime after 1926 I stop seeing pictures of Theresa in our 
scrapbooks. She must have died around then. Tom lived on until 1943, and he 
lived in Los Angeles at the time near where my mother and many other relatives 
had moved. Interestingly, he was taken back to Missouri Valley to be buried. 
When I visit Missouri Valley every year to see my ancient cousins, I always go 
to the cemeteries. I have several pictures of headstones but for some reason I 
don't think I have one of Tom and Theresa's. Maybe next year.</i><br>
