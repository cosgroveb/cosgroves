(Elisabeth) Young (1921 -1967) in March of 1946. Bette was the daughter of a 
divorced German mother, Louise Young, who had been raised in the Amana Colonies. 
Bette had 3 older sisters: Florence, Lucille and Lillian, and an older brother 
Herman. Dad served in the Navy during WWII on an LST. His diaries of that time, 
and the invasion of Normandy are forthcoming. Jim attended high school at St. 
Ambrose Academy and graduated from the Illinois College of Chiropody in Chicago, 
and briefly was in practice in Davenport. </span></p>

the Navy. On one of John's few leaves, he regaled us with a vivid, breathtaking 
description of his beach landing during the invasion of the Peleleu (I think) 
Islands. He was a radioman assigned to establish shore contact for the troops. 
He was burdened with, besides elaborate radio equipment, his golf clubs. 
overnight luggage and the parrot's cage; (shouldn't every sailor worth his salt 
have one?) Jim was in the opposite theater as a Motor Machinist's Mate on an L. 
He reached CPO status just before demobilization. An enormous accomplishment in 
his 2 or 3 years. (In the normal course of advancement I was entitled to take 
the exam for 1st class petty officer only in the last few months of my fourth 
year.) Both boys encouraged us to remember that if we needed to choose, the Navy 
offered at least three hot meals a day and a place to sleep. That was the most 
persuasive advice I needed when it was my turn to choose.</span></i></p>

<i><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Century Gothic">Were he still 
alive my bro and your father would be 83 today. We always knew when Jim's 
birthday was as it came so quick after Xmas and he was overlooked many times I 
suspect as everyone worn out and broke after Xmas...Mother and Dad were married 
Jan l2 l921 and Jim was born Dec 27 l921... They didnt waste any time... I was 
21 months later and Tom was 4 years after me and Sheila was 8 years after 
Tom...Your father was quite a guy. He was a READER!!!!!!! Jim never cared for 
sports when we were little... He preferred to read and he read all kinds of 
stuff. He was a real book worm. I don't recall his going to the Library (as I do 
now) much ... He prob bought a lot of &quot;pocket books&quot; which were popular in those 
days and all well know books came out in &quot;pocketbooks&quot;...Maybe he did go to 
library but it was way downtown but he may have stopped in ... Before he went to 
war he had pretty good job at Arsenal. He urged me to come over and I did... I 
didn't have as good a job as he did and didn't make the $ he did... I had a car 
pool ride to the Arsenal and the driver wanted me to get my bro Jim to also ride 
with us as then he could pick up two guys in one stop but Jim didn't want to red 
in the car pool... He would take bus downtown and then the bus to the Arsenal. 
He would stop downtown I suppose and play pinball machines at Martin Cigar Store 
which was a sort of gathering place for all the young guys... 3rd and Brady...I 
never understood what it was he did at the Arsenal but had something to do with 
time cards or some thing or job time or something. I was a mail man and rode 
around to the various plants with inter office mail....Had a bicycle that they 
furnished and in Winder it wasn't such a good job but was nice rest of the 
year..Mother would make coffee and we were all coffee drinkers ... Jim used to 
take piece of toast, put butter and PEANUT BUTTER on it AND THEN DIP IT IN HIS 
COFFEE!!!!!!!! I would almost get sick to my stomach watching him do that but he 
did it EVERY DAY....Jim was not a &quot;people person&quot;... He didn't have lot of 
friends but those he had were very close... Jack Herman (who I hated cause he 
always teased the hell out of me and Jim wouldn't defend me) Don Noth, Jimmy 
Thompson and another pal who I forget the name and those last two Jimmy and guy 
I cant recall the name were both killed in the war...Don Noth went to Wash DC 
after the war and had a Govt job...Dont know what ever happened to Jack Herman 
(and dont really care)..... I know Jim kept in touch with him some after the war 
but he lived in the South somewhere St Louis I think...Anyway, thinking of Jim 
today... He was always good to me and I was the &quot;younger pain in the ass 
brother&quot; I guess...</span></i></p>

lived in Grandma Doyle's house first, then in a duplex on 12th Street, then over 
the Elks. (The building is gone now, but it was directly across from the police 
station (on Fourth?) Dad had an office next to our apartment in the building 
next to the Elks Club, on the second floor. Dad tended bar at the Elks Club, and 
would walk across the roof outside our side window to get over there to work. 
When it was really hot in the summer, he would bring over one of the huge fans 
they had to cool the banquet room.&nbsp; Dad also worked second shift at French &amp; 
Hecht as an inspector. I remember having to go get him once or twice when mom 
was sick. Mike was a baby in that apartment, then we moved up to Grand Ct. in 
St. Paul's parish to a big old house, that we couldn't afford to heat upstairs.

moved to East Moline when I was in third grade, and I cried my eyes out for 
days. I hated leaving Davenport. I guess I also knew moving into the projects, 
called &quot;the courts&quot; was a step down. Dad worked as a staff podiatrist at the 
East Moline State Hospital. (Michael works now at the same facility--only it has 
become a prison).&nbsp; Mother had open heart surgery at Iowa City when I was in 
fourth grade, shortly after Kathleen was born. I remember how bad mother was 
before her surgery, because mother wasn't supposed to lift anything over five 
pounds and Kevin was born weighing more than eight. Kathleen was a seven pounder, 
and after she was born, and after mom's surgery, we had a little dwarf woman 
from Catholic Charities to take care of us. Christmas that year was awful. She 
felt good for a few more years, and had two more children, but the mitral valve 
clogged up again.&nbsp; There was a time when there were four kids in diapers (Kevin 
and Kath just in night diapers). We would hang all those diapers on the line in 
the winter. They would freeze into solid ice. When we took them in the house the 
ice would evaporate and they would be dry. Magic. </span></i></p>

moved to the top of 7th Street hill, into an old summer house. Mother hated that 
old house, and I just loved it. There was a circular gravel drive and trees all 
around and a path to the bottom of the hill. Later Mom &amp; Dad built a house on 
39th Avenue, Mom worked at night at the Gas &amp; Electric Company, Dad tended bar 
at Regal Lanes and later the Legion, still working at the State Hospital. Bette 
died in the fall of 1967, the night before a scheduled second heart surgery.

was drafted and given a choice of the Army or Marines. He was more macho than 
me. Tommie chose the Marines as well. He and I shared a weekend leave in Laguna 
Beach in 1951 while he was at Camp Pendleton. We had supper, got sloshed and 
visited a newly-wed Marine reservist friend of mine from college in Laguna, 
enjoying his honeymoon until we arrived to take up overnight lodgings with them. 
That guy hasn't spoken to me since.</span></i></p>

(Immaculate Conception Academy) in Davenport, and received her RN from&nbsp; St. 
Anthony's Hospital in Rock Island, IL.&nbsp; She married Barry Kautz of Pekin, IL in 
August of 1961. They lived in Homewood near Chicago for many years where Barry 
taught speech and theater at Homewood-Flossmoor High.&nbsp; Sheila has always been a

weekends to make wedding plans and play &quot;Rap Poker&quot; on Gallaghers' porch with 
Agnita, Dolores, Jim, Kathleen and Jack--always a fun time! Neoma (Darrell 
Doyle's wife and Barry's aunt) had a shower for me and besides a gift everyone 
brought their favorite recipe. Dolores, Julie and Mary Gallagher all brought 
crazy recipes and I still have them: RIC HAL--GADO- GADO!</span></i></p>

home to pick up all the wedding presents to take back to Park Forest, all the 
gifts were unwrapped! Kathleen opened everything to see who it was from and what 
it was--so I come by this trait naturally! She didn't fill names in the book, 
though, and some of the cards were missing, and I'm sure some people never 
received thank-you notes. One was an aunt of Barry's who wrote to his mother--so 
I really made points with her!</span></i></p>
